# vm_for_se_problem

This repository creates virtual machine instances on Google Cloud Platform. The python script `create_VM_instance_Master_Node.py` creates a VM Instance which can act as a Master Node for our Distributed Software Application. Similarly, the python script `create_VM_instance_Worker_Node.py` creates three VM instances in a different zone area. These intances act as worker nodes for our application. The shell script `startup_intance.sh` exectutes all the commands on the created VM Instance and thus installs git and python3(along with it's supporting libraries). The shell script `upload_application.sh` uploads application repo present onto the local device to the VM instance running on google cloud.
